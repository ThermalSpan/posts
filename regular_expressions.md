* checking if something is in a set!
* Not emails, but maybe last names in spacing?
* Or addresses?
* Or something on an alphabet that doesn't use characters? so we can stress the generality of the pure definition later? Perhaps something like trains?
* Lol we could have half life 2 inspired interlude with train types! Finite sets of cars! Civilian and combine! But also the WAY THINGS WORK

Then we will go into more formal detail about what they are. First thing would regular languages. Regular expressions are then presented as a language whose sentences are valid regular anguages. Sentences in the instructions that make regular exressions.  
* A formal defintions in terms of an alphabet and the basic operations
* Some of the usual ${a, b, c}$ or ${0, 1}$ examples, but make them connect to other things, like Huffman codes[^1]

[^1]: Huffman codes have a special ordering. How do we want to reference them? Would be sweet to have links to other cool articles and then link them, but also have a page of linked pages, could have an auto generated pages thing goin on, with a sweet expanding tree like interface. That would be sooooo dope.


From there we will demonstrate and fully explore the "high level" features that we want. Things like character classes. These are characters that
